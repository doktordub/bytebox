# Backend Orchestration Implementation Plan

**Document:** `backend-orchestration-plan.md`  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Source alignment:** `backend-orchestration-architecture.md`, `backend-session-service-plan.md`, `backend-llm-gateway-plan.md`, `backend-memory-store-adapter-plan.md`, `backend-tooling-mcp-client-plan.md`, and the current backend implementation baseline  
**Repository rule:** all backend application code lives under `backend/`

Implementation note (2026-07-01): the default direct-agent path now consumes workflow-state continuity through a bounded prior-turn window plus optional persisted `session_summary` compaction, and orchestration trace summaries expose only safe continuity counters rather than raw prompt history.

---

## 1. Purpose

This plan converts the orchestration architecture into an implementation sequence that can be delivered in small, low-risk phases.

The plan is intentionally strict about repository boundaries:

- Backend application code belongs in `backend/`.
- Backend source modules belong in `backend/app/`.
- Backend tests belong in `backend/tests/`.
- Backend configuration files belong in `backend/config/`.
- Backend local data files belong in `backend/data/`.
- Documentation updates belong in `docs/`.
- No backend orchestration, strategy, session-runtime, or gateway code should be placed in the repository root, `frontend/`, or `mcp/`.

For clarity, this document uses filesystem paths such as `backend/app/orchestration/runtime.py`. Python imports may still use the `app.*` package path because `backend/` is the Python project root.

---

## 2. Review Outcomes

The orchestration architecture document is implementation-ready and strong on boundary rules, provider neutrality, streaming safety, trace correlation, and the intended sequencing between session, LLM, memory, tooling, and later agent work.

The review also confirms that this phase is not greenfield work. The repository already contains a meaningful orchestration slice under `backend/` that should be deepened rather than replaced:

- `backend/app/orchestration/core.py` already defines a narrow `OrchestrationRuntime` protocol plus `EchoOrchestrationRuntime` and `DirectAgentOrchestrationRuntime`.
- `backend/app/testing/fakes/fake_orchestration_runtime.py` already provides a deterministic fake runtime used by session tests.
- `backend/app/session/service.py` already delegates both non-streaming and streaming chat behavior to an orchestration runtime boundary.
- `backend/app/config/bootstrap.py` already wires `DirectAgentOrchestrationRuntime` into `DefaultSessionService` during lifespan startup.
- `backend/tests/unit/orchestration/test_tooling_integration.py` already proves that the current direct runtime can execute tool calls through the real `ToolGateway` path.
- `backend/app/config/schemas.py` and `backend/app/config/validation.py` already validate top-level `usecases`, `strategies`, and `agents` definitions that the runtime depends on today.
- `backend/app/foundation/capabilities.py` already exposes enabled use cases to the API capability surface, albeit directly from configuration instead of through an orchestration-owned capability boundary.

The main implementation concerns that must be resolved during execution are:

1. **A dedicated orchestration settings surface does not exist yet.**  
   The current runtime depends on `app.active_usecase` plus top-level `usecases`, `strategies`, and `agents` sections. The architecture expects a canonical top-level `orchestration.*` section with typed defaults, strategy settings, use-case settings, limits, and safe debug toggles.

2. **The runtime interface and data ownership are still too thin.**  
   `backend/app/orchestration/core.py` exposes only `run` and `stream` over generic `RequestContext` and `WorkflowStateDocument`. The architecture requires orchestration-owned request/context/result models, `WorkflowStateDelta`, safe stream events, and public `health()` / `capabilities()` methods.

3. **`core.py` currently mixes too many responsibilities.**  
   Route resolution, configured agent loading, orchestration-context construction, streaming request assembly, and disabled-tool fallback behavior all live in one module instead of the planned split across runtime, registry, strategy, routing, events, limits, and helper modules under `backend/app/orchestration/`.

4. **The current orchestration context boundary is too permissive.**  
   `DirectAgentOrchestrationRuntime` currently injects workflow-state and trace-store interfaces into the orchestration context. The architecture instead calls for a safe workflow-state snapshot in, a safe state delta out, and trace emission through an observability facade rather than direct trace-store access.

5. **Streaming and non-streaming behavior diverge today.**  
   The current `run(...)` path delegates to `agent.run(context)`, while the current `stream(...)` path assembles its own `LLMRequest` and calls `LLMGateway.stream(...)` directly. The architecture requires both paths to flow through the same strategy/agent boundary so behavior does not drift between chat and streaming.

6. **Strategy ownership is not explicit yet.**  
   There is no `OrchestrationStrategy`, `StrategyRegistry`, `UseCaseRouter`, or built-in `backend/app/orchestration/strategies/` package. The current runtime hard-codes one direct-agent flow rather than resolving strategy behavior through a stable registry.

7. **Health and capabilities do not yet belong to orchestration.**  
   Foundation capabilities currently derive use cases directly from raw configuration, and foundation health has no orchestration-specific readiness component. The architecture requires safe orchestration-owned health and capability summaries.

8. **The orchestration-specific test and fixture surface is still too small.**  
   The repository currently has only a narrow unit slice for orchestration. Dedicated `backend/tests/unit/orchestration/`, `backend/tests/integration/orchestration/`, and orchestration-specific configuration fixtures are still missing for the broader runtime, registry, streaming, and state-delta behavior described by the architecture.

9. **The architecture document has one sequencing ambiguity to resolve during freeze.**  
   Section 3 points next to `backend-workflow-strategies-architecture.md`, while the acceptance criteria mention `backend-agents-architecture.md`. This plan assumes workflow strategies are the immediate follow-on because the architecture sequence places strategy implementations before deeper agent-plugin work.

---

## 3. Non-Negotiable Boundary Rules

- Treat `backend/` as the Python project root for all orchestration work.
- Create orchestration runtime modules only under `backend/app/orchestration/`.
- Keep backend test code under `backend/tests/`.
- Keep backend configuration under `backend/config/` and backend-local data under `backend/data/`.
- Keep documentation-only artifacts under `docs/`.
- Do not place backend orchestration, strategy, session-runtime, or gateway code in the repository root, `frontend/`, or `mcp/`.
- Do not let `backend/app/orchestration/` import `backend/app/api/`, `sqlite3`, `aiosqlite`, `backend/app/persistence/sqlite_*`, `memory_store.service.MemoryService`, ArcadeDB clients, `backend/app/tools/mcp/`, or provider SDKs.
- Do not let the orchestration runtime or strategies persist workflow state directly. Only `SessionService` may save or reset workflow state through `WorkflowStateStore`.
- Do not let the orchestration runtime or strategies write directly to `TraceStore`. Safe trace/event recording must go through the observability facade or recorder layer.
- Do not let `backend/app/orchestration/` import FastAPI request/response types, route modules, or API DTOs.
- Keep the API routes thin and preserve the current HTTP and SSE contracts while orchestration internals change underneath them.
- If compatibility shims are needed during the refactor, keep them under `backend/app/orchestration/` and remove or freeze them before phase close.
- Add only the minimal configured-agent loading boundary needed for orchestration. A broader `backend/app/agents/` package and agent-plugin catalog remain the responsibility of the later agent architecture phase.

## 5. Detailed Implementation Phases

### [DONE] Phase 0. Current Orchestration Walking Skeleton Baseline

**Goal**

Record the orchestration-related work that already exists so the implementation plan extends the current backend instead of re-describing a greenfield slice.

**Files already present**

- [DONE] `backend/app/orchestration/core.py`
- [DONE] `backend/app/orchestration/__init__.py`
- [DONE] `backend/app/testing/fakes/fake_orchestration_runtime.py`
- [DONE] `backend/app/config/bootstrap.py`
- [DONE] `backend/app/session/service.py`
- [DONE] `backend/tests/unit/orchestration/test_tooling_integration.py`

**Implementation outcomes already in place**

- [DONE] The session layer already delegates chat and streaming behavior to an orchestration runtime boundary.
- [DONE] Lifespan startup already wires a real orchestration runtime into `DefaultSessionService` under `backend/app/config/bootstrap.py`.
- [DONE] The current direct runtime already loads configured agents from validated backend configuration.
- [DONE] The current direct runtime already passes LLM, memory, policy, trace, and tool interfaces into an orchestration context.
- [DONE] The current tooling integration test already proves the runtime can reach the real `ToolGateway` path instead of keeping orchestration purely fake.
- [DONE] Deterministic fake orchestration behavior already exists for unit tests under `backend/app/testing/fakes/`.

**Current limitations that the next phases must fix**

- The current orchestration config surface is spread across `app.active_usecase`, top-level `usecases`, top-level `strategies`, and `agents` instead of a canonical `orchestration.*` section.
- The runtime protocol still exposes `run` and `stream` instead of `run_turn`, `stream_turn`, `health`, and `capabilities`.
- The current runtime still mixes routing, agent loading, context construction, streaming assembly, and disabled-tool behavior in `backend/app/orchestration/core.py`.
- The current runtime does not return `WorkflowStateDelta`; state application still happens entirely in the session layer from an answer/result shape.
- The current runtime passes workflow-state and trace-store interfaces into orchestration context rather than a safe state snapshot and observability recorder boundary.
- The current streaming path bypasses the direct agent path and calls `LLMGateway.stream(...)` directly.
- There is no dedicated orchestration strategy registry or built-in strategy package yet.

**Exit criteria**

- [DONE] The implementation plan starts from the real `backend/` baseline and extends it rather than replacing it.

- [DONE] Keep the configured-agent loader intentionally narrow in this phase; do not expand it into a full agent-plugin framework yet.

**Validation**

- [DONE] Run from `backend/`: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/unit/orchestration/test_strategy_registry.py tests/unit/orchestration/test_usecase_router.py tests/unit/orchestration/test_strategy_policy.py`

- [DONE] Emit safe runtime lifecycle events for start, strategy selection, completion, failure, and cancellation.
- [DONE] Build final results through `backend/app/orchestration/result_builder.py` and return `WorkflowStateDelta` instead of mutating or persisting workflow state directly.
- [DONE] Add basic turn and stream counters early so later strategy work can enforce limits consistently.

- [DONE] Implemented `ToolAssistedStrategy` so tool use flows through provider-neutral `ToolIntent`, `ToolExecutionRequest`, and `ToolGateway` only.
- [DONE] Implemented `RouterStrategy` as config/rule-based first, with optional LLM classification only when explicitly configured and policy-approved.
- [DONE] Enforced orchestration limits for:

   - [DONE] max tool calls
   - [DONE] max memory searches
   - [DONE] max LLM calls
   - [DONE] max turn duration

### [DONE] Phase 7. Health, Capabilities, and Composition Root Integration

**Goal**

Make orchestration contribute its own safe readiness and capability metadata through foundation startup rather than leaving that responsibility to raw config readers.

**Files to create or update**

- [DONE] `backend/app/orchestration/health.py`
- [DONE] `backend/app/orchestration/capabilities.py`
- [DONE] `backend/app/config/bootstrap.py`
- [DONE] `backend/app/foundation/container.py`

- [DONE] Add `OrchestrationCapabilitiesResult` with safe use-case and strategy descriptors for API-facing capability aggregation.
- [DONE] Update `backend/app/config/bootstrap.py` so startup constructs strategy registry, strategies, and `DefaultOrchestrationRuntime` explicitly rather than instantiating one direct runtime class only.
- [DONE] Update `backend/app/foundation/container.py` if needed so the runtime is available for startup diagnostics and test wiring.
- [DONE] Update `backend/app/foundation/capabilities.py` to consume orchestration-owned capability data instead of deriving use cases directly from raw config.
- [DONE] Update `backend/app/foundation/health.py` so the backend health payload includes an orchestration component.
- [DONE] Emit a redacted orchestration startup summary that reports safe counts and enabled/default/fallback strategy names without exposing prompts, endpoints, credentials, or database paths.

**Validation**

- [DONE] Run from `backend/`: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/unit/orchestration/test_orchestration_health_summary.py tests/unit/orchestration/test_orchestration_capabilities_summary.py tests/integration/test_startup_orchestration.py tests/unit/test_capabilities.py tests/unit/test_health.py`

- [DONE] Startup wiring follows the architecture sequence closely enough to support later workflow-strategy and agent phases.

### [DONE] Phase 8. Session-Service State-Delta Integration

**Goal**

- [DONE] Replace `orchestrator.run(...)` and `orchestrator.stream(...)` calls with `run_turn(...)` and `stream_turn(...)`.
- [DONE] Persist runtime-returned `WorkflowStateDelta` through session lifecycle helpers instead of assuming orchestration mutated the full state document in place.
- [DONE] Map `OrchestrationStreamEvent` into `SessionStreamEvent` without leaking orchestration internals into the SSE wire format.
- [DONE] Preserve optimistic concurrency, reset semantics, safe history projection, and the current API route contracts.
- [DONE] Remove the remaining default dependence on `EchoOrchestrationRuntime` once the real runtime interface is stable and fully wired.

**Validation**

- [DONE] Run from `backend/`: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/unit/session/test_session_handle_chat.py tests/unit/session/test_session_stream_chat.py tests/integration/session/test_session_with_sqlite_workflow_state_store.py tests/integration/session/test_session_streaming_finalization.py tests/integration/test_api_walking_skeleton.py`

**Exit criteria**

- [DONE] `SessionService` uses the architecture-aligned orchestration runtime interface.

- [DONE] Add dedicated integration coverage for the vertical slices described by the architecture, including session-runtime boundary, runtime-memory integration, runtime-tool integration, safe trace/event recording, and state-delta persistence.
- [DONE] Add opt-in local integration tests for real LLM, memory, and tooling backends only behind deterministic fixtures and explicit enablement.
- [DONE] Update `backend/README.md` to record the stable orchestration boundary, canonical `backend/app/orchestration/` package ownership, validation commands, and explicit deferrals.

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

This plan is complete when:

- The canonical orchestration configuration surface lives under `backend/config/app.yaml` and is exposed through typed helpers in `backend/app/config/`.
- The stable orchestration package lives under `backend/app/orchestration/` with dedicated runtime, strategy, registry, routing, event, error, limits, and capability modules.
- `DefaultOrchestrationRuntime` exposes `run_turn`, `stream_turn`, `health`, and `capabilities`.
- Built-in `echo`, `direct_agent`, `retrieval_augmented`, `tool_assisted`, and `router` strategies are implemented under `backend/app/orchestration/strategies/`.
- Orchestration returns `WorkflowStateDelta` and does not persist workflow state directly.
- `SessionService` remains the only session-facing owner of workflow-state load/save/reset while delegating turn execution to the orchestration runtime.
- Orchestration and strategies call LLM, memory, and tools only through `LLMGateway`, `MemoryGateway`, and `ToolGateway`.
- Orchestration health and capabilities are surfaced safely through the backend foundation layer.
- Raw prompts, raw provider responses, raw tool payloads, raw memory records, credentials, hidden reasoning, and stack traces are not returned, streamed, logged, or traced by default.
- Dedicated unit and integration coverage exists under `backend/tests/unit/orchestration/` and `backend/tests/integration/orchestration/`.
- Validation passes from `backend/` with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest`, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .`, and `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m mypy app`.
